* README

This used to be just my =.emacs= file.  Things have changed over the years and now it's a collection of files that live in the =~/.emacs.d/= directory.

* Using it

Clone this, then:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  cd dot-emacs
  ./install.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

That will create symbolic links to these files inside of =~/.emacs.d= (the link to dot-emacs will be init.el).

The first time you run emacs it will complain about use-package.  You will have to manually install that using M-x package-install.  Then you can quit emacs, reopen it and it will automatically download all the other packages in external-packages.el.
